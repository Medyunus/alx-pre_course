              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>Plastic recycling companies are dedicated to reducing the environmental impact of plastic waste by collecting, processing, and reusing or repurposing plastic materials. Their primary goals include:

                Environmental Conservation: Plastic recycling companies aim to minimize the amount of plastic waste ending up in landfills or oceans, thereby reducing pollution and preserving natural resources.
                Resource Conservation: By recycling plastic materials, these companies contribute to the conservation of raw materials and energy that would otherwise be used in the production of new plastics.
                Promoting Sustainability: Plastic recycling promotes sustainable practices by extending the lifecycle of plastic materials and reducing the need for virgin plastic production, which often involves the extraction of fossil fuels.
                Creating Economic Opportunities: Recycling initiatives can create jobs in collection, sorting, processing, and manufacturing, contributing to local economies and communities.</p>
